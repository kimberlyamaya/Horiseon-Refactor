# Horiseon Code Refactor

**Description**

Refactored the code without changing the website. I refactored this code by adding html semantic elements. This will organize the layout of the website for screen readers and accessibility. I added alternative text to the images so that screen readers will recognize these images and read them aloud.  It also doubles as easy to read organized code. I found and combined like styles in CSS consolidating the CSS file. I fixed the hyperlinks so that when clicked on it takes you to the appropriate section of the page.
